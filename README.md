Created an application to keep our transactions record at one place by adding the both name and the amount of transaction whether it is expense or income.

There were two inputs to take the name of the expense and the amount of it respectively then further the transaction will be displayed on the another side along with the red and green color depends on the type of the transaction that is income or expense.

After calculation the final balance will show up to you on top of the tracker along with the amount of Income and expense section which I have made with the help of material UI, you can also delete the transaction with the given delete icon.
